Yes, a piano can be tuned after many years, and in many cases, it's still possible to bring it back to a stable and tunable condition. Pianos are designed to last for decades, and while regular tuning is ideal to maintain their pitch and overall performance, a well-built piano can withstand long periods without tuning.

However, if a piano has gone without tuning for several years, it is likely to be significantly out of tune, and the process of bringing it back to the desired pitch may take more time and effort compared to a piano that has been regularly maintained. In extreme cases, the piano tuner may need to perform a pitch raise to gradually bring the piano up to the correct pitch, allowing the instrument to settle at the desired tension without putting excessive stress on the structure.

It's important to note that the overall condition of the piano, including factors like humidity, temperature fluctuations, and the piano's general maintenance, can affect its tuning stability. If you're considering tuning a piano that hasn't been tuned in a very long time, it's advisable to consult with a professional piano tuner. They can assess the piano's condition and provide guidance on the best approach to tuning and any potential additional adjustments that may be needed.
