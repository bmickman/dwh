Tipping movers in New York City is customary and sometimes expected, although it is ultimately up to your discretion. While it's not mandatory, tipping is a way to show appreciation for the hard work and effort put in by the moving crew to ensure a smooth and successful move. In New York City, where the cost of living is high and the work can be physically demanding, tipping movers is a common practice.

You can tip in cash, though you may also include the tip with your payment method of choice via the payment application of your choice.

Tipping movers in New York City is a personal decision, and it's a gesture that is greatly appreciated.  It can go a long way in recognizing and rewarding the hard work of the moving team, and making sure the team looks forward to the next job. We realize not everyone has the budget for tipping, and we at Dudes With Hands are always happy that you chose to do business with our team. We heavily rely on reviews and references.
