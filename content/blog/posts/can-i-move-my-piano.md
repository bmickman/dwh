Yes, moving a piano can cause it to go out of tune. The process of moving a piano involves changes in its position, orientation, and sometimes even the environment. These changes can affect the tension in the piano's strings, leading to a temporary shift in pitch.

Here are some reasons why moving a piano can impact its tuning:

String Tension:

The tension in the piano's strings is crucial for maintaining pitch. When a piano is moved, the jostling and changes in position can cause slight variations in string tension.
Environmental Changes:

Moving a piano to a different location, especially to a new climate or environment, can expose it to different levels of humidity and temperature. These changes can influence the wood and metal components of the piano, affecting its tuning stability.

Physical Stress:

The physical stress on the piano during the moving process, even if done carefully, can contribute to temporary changes in tension. This is why it's common for pianos to require tuning after being moved.
