Yes, the standard pitch for most Western music, including pianos, is A440. This means that the A above middle C is tuned to vibrate at 440 Hz. A440 has been widely adopted as the international standard pitch for musical instruments and orchestras.

When pianos are tuned, the goal is typically to have each note accurately set to its intended pitch, following the A440 standard. This standardization ensures that musical instruments can be played together in harmony, and it allows for consistency across different musical ensembles and recordings.

However, there are situations where a piano might be tuned to a different pitch, especially in historical contexts or when playing with certain instruments that use a different pitch standard. In such cases, the piano tuner would adjust the pitch accordingly. But for most modern music, and for pianos used in conjunction with other instruments, A440 is the standard tuning pitch.

If a piano is significantly out of tune, the tuner may tune it to the nearest possible pitch, depending on the condition of the strings.
