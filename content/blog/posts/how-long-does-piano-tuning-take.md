A piano tuning usually takes between one and two hours. 
If the piano hasn't been tuned for a long time or is significantly out of tune, it may take longer to bring it back to the desired pitch and stability. Additionally, if there are any issues with the piano that require extra attention, such as broken strings or damaged components, the tuning process may take longer.
