The frequency with which a piano should be tuned depends on various factors, including the piano's age, climate conditions, and how often it is played. In general, it is recommended to have a piano tuned at least twice per year for minimal maintenance.

However, some factors may necessitate more frequent tuning:

New Pianos: New pianos, during their first year, may require more frequent tuning as the strings and other components settle.

Climate Changes: Pianos are sensitive to changes in humidity and temperature. If you live in an area with extreme climate variations, your piano may require more frequent tuning.

Frequency of Use: Pianos that are played frequently may go out of tune faster than those that are played less often.

Professional Use: Concert pianos used for performances or recording sessions may need tuning before each event.

It's important to note that neglecting regular tuning can lead to more significant issues, as the piano's pitch may drift significantly over time. Additionally, regular maintenance, including tuning and other adjustments, helps preserve the instrument's overall health and performance.
