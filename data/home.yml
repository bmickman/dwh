  <p>
    Hello! My name is Brandon and I run New York City's friendliest small moving company.
    Dudes With Hands (But No Vans!) started out as just a small crew of dudes that are passionate about various careers, 
    incuding art, music, creative endeavors, and of course, our families.  
    Now, we've grown to...yes, still a small crew that's just big enough to get the job done! 
    </p>
    <p>
    Although the cast of movers has rotated throughout the years, the vetting process for adding new team members
    sets us apart from other companies. The core principles of Dudes With Hands is to show up on time, never cancel, 
    and always remain positive! We know that moving can be stressful, and we aim to make it less so.
    Many former customers have called after being cancelled on by other moving companies, so know the importance of 
    hiring reliable movers that you can count on! Dudes With Hands (but no vans!) are the movers who will actually show up!
    
  </p>
  <p>
  After hundreds of jobs and countless couches moved around impossible corners, we're still passionate about helping long-time New Yorkers, as well
    as the city's newest residents move in and out of one of the greatest cities in the world.
